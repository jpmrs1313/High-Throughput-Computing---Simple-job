# Parallel Video Resizing using HTC Cluster
Welcome to this repository, where you will find all the necessary components to submit jobs to an HTC cluster and resize a video in parallel. This repository contains the configuration files and scripts to split a video into multiple parts, resize each part on separate machines, and finally join the resized parts back into a single video.

This repository is part of an academic work, where the goal is to reduce the resolution of a video by dividing the task into smaller, parallelizable tasks. By doing so, we can take advantage of the computational power of multiple machines and speed up the process.

The repository contains the scripts and configuration files needed to run each step of the process on the HTC cluster. Simply follow the instructions in the included files to submit the jobs and start the resizing process.

By using this repository, you will be able to efficiently resize a video by taking advantage of the parallel processing capabilities of the HTC cluster.
